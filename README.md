# 14.odin_linked_lists

[Task Description](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-linked-lists)

In this lesson, I practice how to add, find, insert, remove a Node in a Linked List.

I learn:

1. JavaScript doesn't support the address opeartor like other programming languages (e.g. C). So I use nested objects to simulate the linked list.
2. How to create a reference to an object.
